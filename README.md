This GitHub repository contains the source code for a CGPA Calculator Desktop App that calculates a student's CGPA based on their current semester's SGPA and their previous semester's GPA. The app prompts the user to input their course grade, course name, and credit hours for each of their seven courses, and then calculates the SGPA using the provided formula. The user is also asked to input their previous semester GPA and credits, which are used to calculate the final CGPA. The app is built using JavaFX and provides an intuitive graphical interface for ease of use. With this app, students can quickly and accurately calculate their CGPA and track their academic progress over time.
